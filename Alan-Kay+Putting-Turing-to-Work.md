The actual situation in practical computing is kind of abysmal. A book has 400 pages 50 lines a page that's 20,000 lines in a book and so a 1,000,000 lines of code is about a meter of books and the Empire State building is about 440,000,000 lines of code high of stacked books. If you look at vanilla personal computing the operating system. I'm not pointing the finger at Microsoft here because Apple has the same problem and Linux is also large... there are just a lot of lines of code in the operating system, and you haven't done anything yet. The operating is the province of people of who have many many jobs but in fact you have to have applications and these have grown very large several hundred millions of lines of code for a kind of vanilla personal computing is not too large an estimate. A large financial products company I know of has recently gone over the 400,000,000 million lines of code that they have to actively maintain for their clients. So we're talking about... Remember what you get to see on the screen is maybe 30 or 40 lines of code... So you have this thing where-- this immense thing like a garbage dump-- is being created, but it doesn't look that bad because you're only looking at one thrown-away tin can at a time.

Constraint system that is reliable enough and doesn't lead to superstition Something that takes these math and biology ideas A new math of covering the heuristics. Like the ants in biology.

One of the things I worry about is superstition. The biggest problem with almost all of the automatic systems we have today is that they're brittle. They work in a narrow domain and there' i's no warning when you get to the fringes of them and they may suddenly become much less reliable and people will often say "so what. you're not paying me to be reliable. You're paying me to get my job done." You see this in children. So some of the systems that have been done for children have some magic properties, but the problem is that when the magic properties fail the children do the exact opposite of what you'd like them to do... which is to think about what's going on, they actually start moving things around randomly hoping that some sequence of stuff is going to work better than the sequence they have, and that is a disaster. That is not unknown to adult programmers.

We're now getting into morality and ethics. One of the things I liked about the old cars that I grew up with in the 40s was that you could take them apart and put them back together in a weekend. Yeah, they weren't as capable as today's cars, but they were understandable. and they were like today's cars in that many of the things that are done in today's cars in can be learned very fruitfully by comparing them to these much simpler things. When you open the hood on a piece of software that is not what you see. You see only the thing that the programmer did. Theres no attempt to give you a model. I think the model should be in there because the model could be something like the specs, could be the requirements, it could be the simple thing that runs very slowly but computes the right result and it's actually readable by  humans. There's a whole bunch of things that we could do if we were morally committed to it. No company is making anybody do that right now. From my standpoint I think we are morally committed --should be committed to it --because children need to look at stuff done by adults not just stuff done by other children. This is a huge problem. As Minski said "What every child really needs is a friendly adult." Because the problem with going to grade two with other second graders is what you learn is what second graders do. And a child in the midst of adults doing things like music and stuff like that is in the midst of stuff that can be aspired to. Where it's hard to aspire to something in grade two.
