#Transcripts of talks 

If a talk has changed your life, there is no better way to show your love (and share it) than to key it word-for-word into a markdown file.

To contribute add a file named "{Author of Talk}+{Title of Talk}.md" for example 
`Alan-Kay+Putting-Turing-to-Work.md`

Inside the markdown enter the title, the speaker, the venue, the date, and the URL to the talk. For example

```
